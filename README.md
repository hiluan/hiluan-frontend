## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React.JS, Node.JS, Express.Js, MongoDB, Redux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

1. Navigation Bar:

Navigate to 6 pages: Home, My Apps, My Design, About Me, My Resume, and Contact.
There are 2 versions:
- Home Page has a wider Nav. Bar with a link to download my resume.
- Other Pages have a small Nav. Bar to navigate between pages.


2. FrontPage:
- Download a PDF version of my resume from here.
- The video is from Youtube. It is auto-played whenever the page loads.


3. Other Pages:
Each page has its own info about me, my skills, and my experience.


## Optimizations
Mouse scrolling should be used to move between pages. 
This would create a smoother experience and visitors don't have to find the buttons to click.
Dark mode / Light mode still needs to be done.

## Lessons Learned:

Experiment with using Grid. It is fast and easy to organize the page.
However, with Grid, the transition of the Navigation Bar from wide (home page) to narrow (other pages) still cannot be optimized for smoother transformation.   
  

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
