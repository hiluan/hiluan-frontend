            Currently working for my startup: Cinciao.com, which allows
            celebrities to send personalized video messages to fans in Vietnam.
            Before that, I worked in the architecture and fashion industry.
          </p>
          <p className="intro-description">
            Technology always fascinates me because one great and well executed
            idea could change millions lives, unlike fashion or architecture
            where one idea could help only dozens. This is one of the reasons I
            want to switch my career path to become a software engineer.
          </p>
          <p className="intro-description">
            My name is Luan Pham. Iâ€™m passionate about creating things that
            could change the world, things that could change people's lives. I
            will do whatever it takes to make it.
